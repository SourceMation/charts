## Overview

Istio is an open source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications. Istio’s powerful features provide a uniform and more efficient way to secure, connect, and monitor services. Istio is the path to load balancing, service-to-service authentication, and monitoring – with few or no service code changes. It gives you:
* Secure service-to-service communication in a cluster with mutual TLS encryption, strong identity-based authentication and authorization
* Automatic load balancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, and TCP traffic
* Fine-grained control of traffic behavior with rich routing rules, retries, failovers, and fault injection
* A pluggable policy layer and configuration API supporting access controls, rate limits and quotas
* Automatic metrics, logs, and traces for all traffic within a cluster, including cluster ingress and egress
