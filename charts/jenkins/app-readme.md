## Overview

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build,
test, and deploy their software efficiently. It supports continuous integration
(CI) and continuous delivery (CD) by automating parts of the software
development process, including code integration, testing, and deployment to
production environments. With a rich ecosystem of plugins, Jenkins integrates
with various tools and platforms, making it highly flexible and customizable for
a wide range of development pipelines.
